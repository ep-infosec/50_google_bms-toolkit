Role Name
=========

Ansible Role: hugepages 

Enable Huge Pages on Linux for oracle purposes

For calculation of the hugepages usualy the math goes like this:

X = grep Hugepagesize /proc/meminfo => (the default value is 2048KB = 2MB)
Y = all client SGAs in MB  =>  (we usualy take 70% of the overall RAM since sometimes we can not plan ahead how much SGA would be required for the database but in any case we usually don't go higher then 70% of the overall RAM )
Z = #Huge Pages needed = Y / X 

Also since database SGA size is tightly related with SHMMAX and SHMALL kernel parameters values the ansible hugepages role sets shmmax, shmall, shmmni and hugepages as bundle.  

kernel.shmmax=70% of RAM memory in Bytes
kernel.shmall= kernel.shmmax / kernel.shmmni

Also the oracle memlock limit is set to unlimited (both: soft and hard) as per the oracle recommendations

The algorithm used in the ansible hugepages role is the following:

if shmmax is not set in sysctl.conf
then 
        set shmmax=70% of the RAM
        set shmmni= take the value from memory (usually the default is 4096)
        set shmall=shmmax/shmmni
         set hugepages=shmmax in MB/Hugepagesize in MB
         reload sysctl
else
      if shmmax < 70% of the RAM
      then 
            set shmmax=70% of the RAM
            set shmmni= take the value from memory (usually the default is 4096)
            set shmall=shmmax/shmmni
            set hugepages=shmmax in MB/Hugepagesize in MB
            reload sysctl
       else
            if shmmax < total RAM
            then
                  set shmmni= take the value from memory (usually the default is 4096)
                  set shmall=shmmax/shmmni
                  set hugepages=shmmax in MB/Hugepagesize in MB
                  reload sysctt
             else
                   set shmmax=70% of the RAM
                   set shmmni= take the value from memory (usually the default is 4096)
                   set shmall=shmmax/shmmni
                   set hugepages=shmmax in MB/Hugepagesize in MB
                   reload sysctl
